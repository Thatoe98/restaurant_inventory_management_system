## The Problem

### Current Industry Challenges

Restaurants face significant operational challenges:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Manual inventory tracking | 15-20% of inventory lost to waste, theft, or errors |
| Delayed financial reporting | Decisions made on outdated data |
| Disconnected systems | Staff wasting time on duplicate data entry |
| Lack of visibility | Owners don't know true profit margins |
| Paper-based processes | Prone to errors, not searchable |

### The Cost of Inaction

A typical restaurant operating without proper management systems experiences:
- **3-5% higher food costs** due to over-ordering and spoilage
- **2-4 hours daily** on manual reporting and data entry
- **Missed opportunities** from not identifying top performers
- **Cash flow problems** from delayed financial visibility
- **Theft and shrinkage** that goes undetected
